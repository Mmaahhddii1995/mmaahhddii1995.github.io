## About

Mahdi Rahimi is currently in the final year of his PhD, which he began in June 2021 under the supervision of **Prof. Claudia Díaz** at **KU Leuven**, within the **COSIC** research group. His research focuses on the practicality and security of anonymous communication systems—particularly **mix networks (mixnets)**—as well as broader topics in privacy-preserving systems and applied cryptography.

Prior to his PhD, he received a **BSc in Electrical Engineering** from **K. N. Toosi University of Technology** in 2018 and an **MSc in Cryptography and Secure Communication** from **Sharif University of Technology** in 2020. His master’s thesis focused on **information-theoretic approaches to network security**.

## Research Statement

My research lies at the intersection of **security, privacy, and society**, with a focus on making strong privacy guarantees practical and deployable. I work on overcoming long-standing limitations in **mix networks**, particularly latency and scalability, which have historically prevented their adoption in real-world systems. My contributions are now considered part of the **state of the art in mixnet research** and aim to enable scalable, low-latency anonymous communication for everyday internet use.
