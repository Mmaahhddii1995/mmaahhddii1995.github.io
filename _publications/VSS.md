title: "On Round-Optimal Computational VSS"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/VSS.md
excerpt: 'We propel the state-of-the-art in round-optimal computa-
tional VSS schemes, providing more efficient solutions. The efficiency and simplicity of
these new round-optimal VSS schemes render them invaluable tools for various classic and
post-quantum secure threshold protocols, such as distributed key generation protocols and
threshold signature schemes.'
