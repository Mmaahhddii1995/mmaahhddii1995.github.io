excerpt: 'Mix networks (mixnets) offer robust anonymity even against adversaries monitoring all network links; however, they impose high latency on communications. To address this, recent research has explored strategic low-latency routing within mixnets. While these strategies appear to reduce latency, their impact on mixnet anonymity has not been carefully assessed, raising concerns about potential deanonymization of clients. Tackling this challenge, this paper first quantifies the anonymity loss associated with low-latency routing techniques in mixnets. Building on these insights, second, we introduce a novel lowlatency routing method that maintains mixnet anonymity while achieving significant latency reductions compared to the state-of-the-art solution LARMix (NDSS, 2024). Our approach also ensures a more balanced load distribution among mixnet nodes. Moreover, under adversarial conditions where parts of the mixnet are compromised, our method does not confer significant advantages to the adversary, unlike LARMix. Thus, our proposal emerges as the optimal choice for low-latency routing in mixnets.'
